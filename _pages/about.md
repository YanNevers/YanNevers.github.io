I am a Tenured−Track professer at the Université de Strasbourg in France. I am part of the Complex System and Translational Bioinformatics team in the ICube laboratory.
I am interested in comparative genomics, both from a methodological and an applied standpoint. My goal is to use robust methods to better understand evolution of genomes and gene repertoires. I am trying to leverage this knowledge to better understand how evolution at the molecular level relate to phenotypical variation across biodiversity.
